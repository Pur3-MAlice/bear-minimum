# **Bear Minimum**
## **Site Overview**
Bear Minimum is an info-tainment (information/entertainment) website educating users on sustainability. The main aim of the website is provide useful advice and information about ways to slowly create a sustainable lifestyle in modern society as well as encourage users to 'get back to nature'. There's very little out there about general encouragement to lead a slightly more sustainible life, a lot of the media around being environmentally friendly is 100% effort or nothing. This website is trying to bridge this gap and create a more positive outlook on both sustainibility and Climate Change.

### **Wireframes**
#### *Desktop*
#### *Mobile*

### **Design**
#### *Color Scheme*
* Having already chosen the Hero/Main image for the Home page I wanted to pick a color pallette that would tie in cohesivly with the image (which would be used universally around the site). I knew that coolors.co had a image color extraction which could pick out the exact colors that would work to this effect. The effect I wanted to pull off was natural, elegant and calming. The Visual Identity of this website should give the user a calm, relaxed feeling. No overly bright or neon colors. 
![Color Pallette Picker](docs/screenshot/color-pallette-picker.png)
* I also knew that coolors.co gave you all the HEX, rbga and HSL codes ready to copy and paste for the colors picked. By consolidating each branding asset (images, colors, fonts) into a cohesive aesthetic, this develops brand recognition, which in turn is good UX.

![Color Export](docs/screenshot/css-pallette-export.png)
#### *Typography*
* Whilst doing research into the best Google Font combinations, I came across this article: [21 Google Fonts Combinations For Websites & Brands](https://www.garett.co/21-google-fonts-combinations-for-websites-brands). The Teko + Montserrat combination seemed to be the best suited to the aesthetic of the page. Plus their readability is very good, so this is a plus for the accessibility of the website.

## **Universal Features**
### **Header Element**
#### *Logo*
* The website logo is strong and minimalistic, to fit in with the core values of the website. 
* The logo will appear on every webpage for continuity.
* The logo is strongly presented and at the top center of the page so the user's eye naturally goes down the center of the page, where most of the information will be held.

#### *Nav Bar*
* I wanted to add a traditional Navigation bar at the top of my website so the user could easily get from one page to another. 
* The navigation bar appears on all the pages, including the Sign Up form feedback page.
* It contains links to the Home, About, Blogs, and Sign Up pages to allow easy navigation around the website.
* The below image shows the user's current page highlighted using white underline, this is a subtle addition trying to make the users experinces as calm and enjoyable as possible.
* The hover feature was employed to turn the lettering from white to black to make sure the user is aware that this is an active link which they can click.

### **Hero Image**
* For the Hero Image for this project I decided on a nature theme. I chose the Hero Image before deciding on fonts and color schemes, as I wanted to make them both cohesive with the Hero Image. The Hero Image will be used throughout the webpages to add a layer of continunity. The first image I chose from Pexels was too large and was distorted when pushed through. So I read up on best practices for webpage/desktop and found a helpful blog post from Hubspot: "Ultimate Guide to Hero Images [Best Practices + Examples]". I found an appropriate image that then i used to create a color scheme which is described above. 
* I also employed the zoom effect to the main image. Again this was inspired by the Love Running Project, as i liked the effect it had for the User's Experience.
![Hero Image with CTA](docs/screenshot/main-image-call-to-action.png)
* This image is of a forest dappled with sunlight.
* The idea for the Hero Image with the floating CTA was directly inspired by the Love Running Project. However the code was adapted quite a bit for this website, also the user's experience of this is a Call to Action, rather than infomation. It also serves to give the user the explicit subject matter of the site - the site aim is directly stated.

### **Footer**
* For good UX I kept with a traditional website footer of social media links. This is clean and simple and is universal throughout the website. Again the feeling of this site should be calm and serene, this pared down footer is a key part of the continuity of the website.
* I also added the site's philosophy as a wuote to the footer - to maintain the user's understadning of the site's aims.
* There is also a copyright - because I liked the addition.
![Footer image](docs/screenshot/footer-image.png)

## **Page Content Features**
### **About Content**
* The about content needed to be simple. The messaging very easy to absorb and the mission of the site clear. To do this, I adapted a Love Running to fit my purpose. Although this was not as creative as I would have liked the end result does speak for itself and the overall feel of the about page I think really suits the end goal of the site. It is clear, calm and direct. 
![Mission section Image](docs/screenshot/mission-section.png)
* I also reused the 'second call to action' to push the site's main aim of newsletter sign up. This is something that appears in everything bar the blog page and the sign up page itself.
### **Blog Page Content**
* For the Blog page content I wanted to incorporate different mediums. In the future this would look like Videos, Podcasts, Ebooks and Blogs. But for now it's just blogs and podcasts,
* The three blogs were taken from other creators (references in the credits section). They were chosen for their value as 'info-tainment' and their suitablility for the mission of the websote. Instructional wasy to slowly become in tune with nature and make small steps towards a lower individual environmental impact.
* Wanted to link the blogs back to their way the user saw the blog teaserson the home page. So employed either similar images or the same images in larger forms to be used as page breaks. Example below:
![Blog split up image](docs/screenshot/blog-split-up-image.png)
* The blogs are in a typical newpaper fashion, one column, justified paragraphs with centered headers and left-aligend sub-heading. This is a style of blog known to many users and to break away from user expeirence in this case would have become a distraction to the user rather than help them focus on the content and stay calm and serene - which is one of the site's aims.
* I chose the grid display for the podcast section becuase it is nautrally responsive and looks sleek and elegant. It also distracts the user's eye less than large blocks.
![Podcast grid section image](docs/screenshot/podcast-grid-section.png)

### **Sign up Page Content**
* For the Sign Up page I wanted to keep the devices clear of distraction. To convey a calm, modern and sleek look the only thing avalible on this page is the sign up.
* The entire mission for this website is to create return users to consume more content. The Newsletter is the main way the site gets return users.
* Because of the lack of content and the simplified nature of the form - it needed to take center stage. So the form is in the middle of the page. 
* The only options the users have are to click off the page to social media, click within the site or sign up. This simplified user experience will lead to less click off. Trying not to overload the user with too many choices creates the calm user experience thsi website is trying to produce.

## **Future Improvements**
* Somthing I did want to do, but would have been too time consuming to do was to make the blog section on the home page more spread out rather than a singular coloumn. Several coloumns, or even carousels that are with different headings/genres.
* Sign Up page could be GET, and the user could be sent to an internal page rather than the regular POST system.
* I would also make sure that in future blog posts would be continually added, as well as other types of media, such as a shortform video page from content creators that focus on Environmentalism.
* Another improvment would to have other pages linking out both live community events and even a map of zero-waste shops in the area where the user is.
* One more would be live updates to new spotify podcasts by an affiliated podcast AND/OR other trustworthy creators.

## **Credits**
### **References**
* Whilst I did try to deviate as much as possible, this project was influenced by CI’s Love Running Project. Notable similarities are the use of Hero-Images and floated text on top of the Hero-Image, the Missions section in the About Pag is also influenced by the project. 
* I would also like to mention that, before starting this project, I did peruse other CI student’s projects, for both code inspiration and direction. Whilst no code was directly taken from these other projects, I can say that my research did influence how I built the project and created my README.md initially - strong deviations were taken after my research and the inital build. (Notable mentions: David Bowers github: dnlbowers, who I asked permission to do this.)
* I did rely on stack overflow, W3schools, CSS-TRICKS and MDN web docs for general references and problem solving throughout the project.
