# **Bear Minimum**
## **Site Overview**
Bear Minimum is an info-tainment (information/entertainment) website educating users on sustainability. The main aim of the website is provide useful advice and information about ways to slowly create a sustainable lifestyle in modern society as well as encourage users to 'get back to nature'. There's very little out there about general encouragement to lead a slightly more sustainible life, a lot of the media around being environmentally friendly is 100% effort or nothing. This website is trying to bridge this gap and create a more positive outlook on both sustainibility and Climate Change.

### **References**
* Whilst I did try to deviate as much as possible, this project was very influenced by CI’s Love Running Project. Notable similarities are the use of Hero-Images, the Social Media Footer and the style of the Nav Bar. 
* I would also like to mention that, before starting this project, I did pursue other CI student’s projects, for both code inspiration and direction. Whilst no code was directly taken from these other projects, I can say that my research did influence how I built the project initially. (Notable mentions: David Bowers github: dnlbowers, who BLAH BLAH BLAH)
