            <h3>How Nature Can Help Heal Our Planet</h3>
            <h4>Study shows that climate solutions in nature can equal stopping the burning of oil annually</h4>
            <p>An overabundance of man-made carbon dioxide is heating up our atmosphere. It just so happens that our planet is designed to help manage CO2, if we let it.</p>
            <p>We know that by limiting the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere enough to keep global temperatures from rising 2°C higher than they were before the industrial revolution, we have the best chance of avoiding the worst future impacts. If we miss this 2°C threshold, the planet faces threats the<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/11/18/Climate-change-report-warns-dramatically-warmer-world-this-century">World Bank</a> describes as “extreme heat-waves, declining global food stocks, loss of ecosystems and biodiversity, and life-threatening sea level rise.” Some of this we are already seeing.</p>
            <p>The three main ways to limit the carbon in our atmosphere are by curbing the forces that are emitting too much of it in the first place, being more efficient with what we use, and actively capturing and storing some of what is already out there.</p>
            <p>Trees and other plants have perfected this process over hundreds of millions of years of evolution. In fact, we're unlikely to see a better carbon capture and storage technology than that which nature provides—we just need to actively give it the best chance to do its job.</p>
            <p>So just how much carbon can nature realistically capture and store?</p>
            <p>According to a recent study led by The Nature Conservancy along with 15 other organizations, maximizing nature's ability to tackle climate change at a cost-effective price could have the same effect as if the world put a complete stop to the annual burning of oil.</p>
            <p>Just by taking better care of and investing in what grows naturally. Let that sink in.</p>
            <p>The groundbreaking study found that “natural climate solutions” - the conservation, restoration, and improved management of land in order to increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in landscapes worldwide - can provide up to 37 percent of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to keep global temperatures under that 2°C mark. That's 30 percent more than previously estimated.</p>
            <p>There is, however, a catch: The world must act now.</p>
            <p>If we're too slow to start better managing and protecting these natural systems, the inaction will damage nature's ability to help heal the planet.</p>
            <p>If natural climate solutions are mobilized over the next 10 years, they could provide <a href="https://global.nature.org/initiatives/natural-climate-solutions/natures-make-or-break-potential-for-climate-change">37 percent of the needed carbon mitigation for global climate targets</a>. But if action is delayed until after 2030, that number drops to 33 percent because the emissions we're trying to curb would increase and many of these natural areas themselves would degrade and become less effective. If we wait until 2050, the number drops to 22 percent.</p>
            <p>In other words, the longer we wait, the less nature can do.</p>
            <h4>So then, how do we do more now?</h4>
            <p>One striking aspect of this new study is its demonstration that industries that work with and on the land—in particular forestry and agriculture—have a huge opportunity to step up to transform working lands and help them move from being carbon emitters to places that capture and store more carbon than they emit. And governments have the opportunity to make these solutions a formal part of their climate action goals.</p>
            <p>Around the world and in a variety of ecosystems, there are already <a href="https://global.nature.org/initiatives/natural-climate-solutions/ncs-case-studies">examples of wide-scale success</a>. In Indonesia, TNC is advancing reduced-impact logging techniques that are helping to lessen carbon emissions even as the timber industry continues to support economic growth. In Brazil's Serra da Mantiqueira region, a broad coalition is working to reforest nearly 3 million acres of land in the next decade.</p>
            <p>And from farmers in Northern Africa fighting desertification by planting trees to New Guinean fishing communities planting mangroves to attract fish and store carbon, there are many more on-the-ground projects around the world setting the foundation for what is possible.</p>
            <p>At the global level, the Conservancy is working with policymakers and other partners toward an ultimate goal: To provide countries the incentives and support they need to protect forests and other natural carbon sinks at a scale sufficient to fight climate change.</p>
            <p>So, as we continue advances toward a low-carbon economy, we must not lose sight of the solutions that have been under our feet, in the soil and roots, and above our heads, in the forest canopies, this whole time. The fact is, the world won't be able to meet its climate change goals without them.</p>
            <p>Nature can help heal our planet, if we let it.</p>

            <h3>5 Ways to Start Being More Sustainable</h3>
            <p>In today's day and age, learning <strong>how to be more sustainable</strong> is more than a trend—it's an imperative.</p>
            <p>As a consequence of the expansion of human civilization, our planet is suffering from the daily amounts of non-recyclable waste that humans produce. Plastic waste, food and water waste, energy waste, compulsive shopping, etc.—everything we use and purchase has an environmental footprint and consequence. If you'd like to put your daily choices under control, it's time to get informed and take action.</p>
            <p>In case you think that individual effort doesn't count, let's rethink this argument.</p>
            <h4>Why Be More Sustainable?</h4>
            <p>According to <a href="https://www.titlemax.com/discovery-center/lifestyle/trash-one-person-produces-year/#:~:text=If%20you%20divide%20total%20trash,about%2034.3%20percent%20of%20it.">statistics</a>, every American citizen produces an average of 2072 pounds of trash, originating only from their household. For the entire country, that's like 254 million tons of trash per year. Daily, that's some 4.5 pounds per person.</p>
            <p>On a global scale, the world generates <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768">3.5 million tons of plastic</a> and other solid waste, which ends up in the oceans <strong>every day</strong>. This number has been growing for the past <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/global-waste/?utm_term=.b0d0e83c093b">100 years</a> — 100 years ago, we used to produce 10 times less trash than we do now.</p>
            <p>While these numbers may sound devastating, there are things we can do as individuals to make a change. Governmental measures and eco-business policies will play their important role, but <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/05/zero-waste-families-plastic-culture/">changes in lifestyle</a> can also create a positive change and help you produce as little as a single jar of trash per year</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Daily Sustainability Practice: How to Be More Sustainable in Your Everyday Life?</h4>
            <p>Here are a couple of things you can do to improve your daily sustainability practice and produce less waste.</p>
            <h5>1. Eat Seasonal Local Food; Go Vegetarian</h5>
            <p>Hotels, schools, restaurants, and supermarkets throw away enough food to feed all of the world's hungry. However, wasting food goes beyond humanitarian problems - it's also an environmental issue, considering the amount of water and energy necessary to grow, harvest, package, and transport all that food.</p>
            <p>Food that ends up in landfills produces methane as it rots, which makes up for 11% of total greenhouse gas emissions. If all the wasted food was a country, it would be the third highest producer of greenhouse gases, right after the US and China.</p>
            <p>Supermarkets have changed the way we consume food - we tend to eat non-seasonal products that grow in greenhouses and whose transportation is one of the major contributors to the planet's pollution, not to mention how the majority of these products are packed in plastic.</p>
            <p>What Can You Do?</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Buy food from your local vendors and markets.</li> 
                <li>Try to purchase <em>seasonal</em> fruits and vegetables.</li>  
                <li>Make precise grocery shopping plans to actually use all the food that you buy.</li>
                <li>In order to cut down on food waste, plan your meals in advance.</li>
                <li>Practice plastic-free grocery shopping.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/22/eu-farm-animals-produce-more-emissions-than-cars-and-vans-combined-greenpeace">Animal agriculture</a> around the world is responsible for producing more greenhouse gases than the entire world’s transportation systems together. The animals we raise for food produce many times more excrement than the human population. This causes river and lake pollution along with bacteria and virus contamination.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, for every <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/water/2015/02/07/how-much-water-does-it-take-to-make-a-gallon-of-milk/#:~:text=of%20drinking%20water.-,How%20much%20water%20does%20it%20take%20to%20make%20a%20gallon,production%20has%20on%20the%20environment.">1 gallon of cow milk</a> produced, you need at least 4 gallons of water, plus the water needed for growing grass and feeding a cow. For every 1 pound of beef, you need roughly <a href="https://foodtank.com/news/2013/12/why-meat-eats-resources/#:~:text=Shock%20is%20reasonable%20after%20discovering,gallons%3B%20corn%20is%20108%20gallons.">1800 gallons of water</a></p>
            <p>Now imagine if the majority of people switched to a plant-based diet. We'd rationalize water expenditures and CO2 gasses emissions, not to mention that we'd be eating healthier food.</p>
            <p>One person can save up to 219,000 gallons of water every year by implementing veganism and vegetarianism as a daily sustainability practice. Start simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try eating less meat.</li>
                <li>Go for quality over quantity.</li>
                <li>Eliminate one meat dish per week.</li>
                <li>Get into the habit of eating seasonally and locally.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2. Reduce and Reuse Before Recycling</h5>
            <p>We all know the “Reduce, reuse, recycle” catchphrase. Although many countries have sorting and recycling policies, that may not be enough, especially when you put it in a broader context - a lot of the waste is still non-recyclable.</p>
            <p>This way, even if you responsibly sort your plastic, paper, glass, and general waste, there's a lot more you can do before that step: reduce and reuse.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't buy pre-packaged groceries in the supermarket. Instead, visit farmers markets to buy fresh produce or go to specialized vendors who will measure and pack your products in paper wraps. Additionally, use containers or canvas bags when buying some groceries (fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, etc.)
                <li>Consider getting a water filter and say no to single-use plastic bottles.</li>
                <li>If you want to carry water with you or drink your favorite coffee on the go, invest in a good quality reusable bottle and cup. This would be a much cheaper and more sustainable option than buying plastic bottles and cups over and over again.</li>
                <li>Instead of purchasing hard-copy newspapers, subscribe to your favorite medium online. It will be cheaper and you won't end up throwing it away.</li>
                <li>Plastic grocery bags are so old news, and reusable linen bags are forever. If you tend to forget to bring them to the store with you, simply put them on top of your shopping list, or keep a spare one in your bag or car.</li>
                <li>Avoid single-use food and drink containers and utensils, even for work. This means having your own washable and reusable coffee mug, set of silverware, a bowl, and a plate.</li>
                <li>Switch from liquid to hard soap. They usually come in carton boxes instead of plastic bottles. If you find a liquid soap that comes in a glass bottle - you can refill it later or reuse the bottle.</li>
                <li>When it comes to cosmetic products, consider experimenting with organic, home-made haircare and skincare products, or look for brands that use recyclable packaging and clean ingredients.</li>
                <li>Instead of purchasing household chemicals for cleaning, some of which can be toxic, try using multipurpose products you probably already have at home such as alcohol, vinegar, or baking soda.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>3. Purchase Wisely and Support Sustainable Brands</h5>
            <p>It's all of our jobs to make better, mindful choices about our daily decisions, brands we're supporting and products we're purchasing. Be more mindful with everything you consume, from fashion to books, home decor, and everything else. Buy what you need and monitor what you already have.</p>
            <p>You can start by experimenting with buying pre-loved things, from vintage accessories and clothes to unique furniture and decor pieces. You can also give the things you no longer need a second life by selling them or simply donating them to those in need.</p>
            <p>When shopping, the origins of the product you're buying and the way it's manufactured are two other important parameters you could consider. We recommend investing in timeless pieces - something of the good quality that you know will last for a long time.</p>
            <p>Pay attention to some clothing brands that produce clothes out of recycled fabrics. You can also find sneakers, bags, notebooks, and even furniture pieces made of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-using-recycled-plastic-in-products#parley-x-adidas-1">recycled materials</a>.</p>
            <p>These are called green industry businesses that use less water and energy in order to cut on their carbon emissions production and try to reuse the waste they generate instead of producing and tossing additional trash. By adopting the green policies, these companies minimize their environmental impact and act responsibly towards nature and their customers.</p>
            <h5>4. Monitor Household Energy Use</h5>
            <p>Besides the physical trash we produce daily, we also unnecessarily waste a lot of energy. By changing the way we use our appliances, we are not only acting more responsibly towards the planet and doing something good for the environment, but we can also save some money, too.</p>
            <p>Here's how to do it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn off the lights when you're not in the room.</li>
                <li>Turn off appliances that you're not currently using.</li>
                <li>Be careful when purchasing appliances, invest in those that are energy efficient.</li>
                <li>Use a programmable thermostat, so it doesn't overheat when you're not home.</li>
                <li>Dry your clothes outside instead of using the drying machine.</li>
                <li>Use an electric kettle instead of the stove to heat up water.</li>
                <li>Replace incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent ones.</li>
                <li>Use natural light instead of turning the lights on as much as you can.</li>
                <li>Put on an extra layer of clothes instead of turning up the heating.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's a list of appliances that waste the most energy, in case you want to rationalize their usage:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cooling and heating: 47% of the residential energy consumption</li>
                <li>Washer and dryer: 13%</li>
                <li>Water heater: 14%</il>
                <li>Lighting (incandescent light bulbs): 12%</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The rest of the appliances such as the computer, oven, or refrigerator don't make up for more than 5% of an entire household's energy consumption.</p>
            <h5>5. Drive Green</h5>
            <p>While switching to electric or hybrid cars would be amazing, not everyone can afford such a big investment.</p>
            <p>If you're not ready to switch your your car that runs on gas for a more environmentally-friendly solution, there are other things you can do to reduce your carbon footprint:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drive more slowly and avoid hard accelerations or brake slamming.</li>
                <li>Remove heavy items from your vehicle if they're not necessary.</li>
                <li>Try renewable fuels, like E85, which is a blend of ethanol, gasoline, and corn. If you're driving a diesel vehicle, you might be able to give biodiesel B5 a shot.</li>
                <li>Check your tires regularly, as loose tires can contribute to enhancing the emission of pollutants by reducing your gas mileage.</li>
                <li>Shift gears in accordance with the terrain as this can make a real impact on your fuel economy.</li>
                <li>Consider using public transport, walking, cycling and using an electric scooter instead of driving on some occasions.</li>
            </ul>    
            <hr>
            <h5>Bottom Line</h5>
            <p>We believe that every individual's contribution to making our world a healthier and better place counts. If you can spare our planet from one plastic bottle, then do it.</p>
            <p>We also understand that daily sustainability practice isn't what most of us were taught in school. The majority of us grew up never wondering what happens with all the trash we throw away or how even the smallest of purchasing decisions we make every day (such as, for example, buying a pack of 6 bottles of still water for home) can negatively affect the planet. Luckily, we are the generation that can change all this.</p>
            <p>Get informed and do whatever is in your power to practice and promote sustainable lifestyle. We all need to make a collective effort to reduce the unnecessary waste that's destroying the only home we have - our planet.</p>
            <p>Thank you for reading this article. Believe in your abilities to change the world, educate yourself about the best sustainability practices, start small and do something, and make conscious intelligent choices. And remember, improvement isn't about perfection, it's about the progress and commitment.</p>

            <h3>Wildflower Food Forage</h3>
            <p>Many wild plants and flowers are edible and can be used in cooking, and spring is the perfect season to start looking for them. You can discover the full list of items that can be found in spirng by researching online, but here are a few suggestons to kick things off.</p>
            <p>Earlier in spring, you'll find chickweed: one of nature's tasty secrets, which is packed with vitamins and minerals and is delicious in salads. The dandelion (<em>dent de lion</em> - or lion's tooth) is a versitile flower and every part of it can be used in cooking. Its unopened buds can even be put into sauces to give a tang, much like a caper does. Gorse, often found on clifftops, is famous for its coconut and almond tasting flowers. And Japanese knotweed - a notorious problem for gardeners - is vitamin rich! You'll be doing gardeners a favour by picking and eating it, too, so knock yourself out. In mid-spring, alexanders, a.k.a 'horse parsley', is known for its succulent stem, flowers and leaf tips and can be taken home and steamed to serve as an edible garnish. And bramble leaves are great for making tea.</p>
            <p>You'll need to do your homework, as it's essential that you correctly identify the plants and don't mistake them for anything inedible. Edible wildflowers can be found throughout the year, so make a note of what you can find in each season and where in the country it grows. If you're an urban dweller, check out your nearest wood or green space (not your local park). Depending on what you're looking for, you may have to broaden your area. If you can afford to and have the time, hop a train or drive further afield.</p>
            <h4>What You Need for Wildflower Food Foraging</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>A cotton or linin bag (a tote is preferable) for transporting your wildflowers without suffocating them. You can also take a lined basket.</li>
                <li>Ideally, you should invest in an eyeglass to help you properly identify your wildflowers. Some flowers look very similar to others, so it's vital that you correctly identify them. You'll need to check the characteristics of your edible plant are exactly right to make sure you know which plants are edible and which must be avoided in case they're dangerous to consume.</li>
                <li>Hardy work or gardening gloves. To protect your hands as you forage - there is a chance your skin may be senstive or allergic to some wildflowers.</li>
                <li>A good parir of pruners for careful cutting of your wildflowers.</li>
                <li>Sensible clothes. Make sure to protect your legs and arms by wearing long clothing. Nettle rash is not too much fun...</li>
